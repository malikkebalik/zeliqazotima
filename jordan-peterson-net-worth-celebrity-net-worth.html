Jordan Peterson is known for his somewhat controversial comments on political, social, and cultural issues.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jordan Bernt Peterson was born on June 12, 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta, and grew up in nearby Fairview. He was the oldest of three children to Walter, a school teacher, and Beverley, a librarian. In junior high school, Jordan met and befriended future leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party, Rachel Notley. As a young man, he concluded that religion was for the ignorant and superstitious and became obsessed with the Cold War and possibility of a nuclear apocalypse.</p><h2 id=education><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>Jordan Peterson graduated from Fairview High School in 1979 and entered Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature. He later transferred to the University of Alberta where he completed his BA in political science in 1982. He took a year off to visit Europe and started studying the psychological origins of the Cold War before returning to the University of Alberta to receive his BA in psychology in 1984. The next year, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University to earn his PhD in clinical psychology.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Jordan Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto and was previously a professor at McGill University as well as Harvard University. Peterson has authored the three books, 1999's "Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief," 2018's "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos," and 2001's "Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life." He has also hosted his own podcast called The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast. He created the Self Authoring Suite which is a writing therapy program.</p><p>Jordan gained attention in 2016 thanks to a series of YouTube videos in which he criticized political correctness as well as the Canadian government's Bill C-16 which added gender identity as "compelled speech" making it mandatory to refer to someone using specific language.</p><p>In 2022, Peterson signed a content distribution deal with "The Daily Wire," a conservative media company. He also became the Chancellor of Ralston College. He has garnered millions of views on his various lectures and conversations across YouTube and his podcasts.</p><h2 id=earnings><strong>Earnings</strong></h2><p>In a 2019 interview with Martin Weill, Jordan claimed that he was making $80,000 per month from his Patreon account at that point. He deleted his Patreon account in January of 2019. In the same interview, Jordan claimed to be earning <a href=#>$35,000 per speaking engagement</a> and roughly $200,000 per month from his consulting firm/clinical practice.</p><p>Jordan has also presumably earned a decent chunk of <a href=#>money from book royalties</a>. He has reportedly sold around 5 million books during his career to date. If he was earning just $1 per book sold, that would be $5 million pre-tax, though it's unclear what actual rate he's receiving or how many books he may have needed to sell to pay down production costs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-344415 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jordan-Peterson.jpg alt="Jordan Peterson" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-344415 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Chris Williamson/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Jordan Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989, and the couple had a daughter, Mikhaila, and a son, Julian. Mikhaila grew up to have a career as a political commentator and podcaster.</p><p>Jordan suffered some health problems from 2019 through 2020 in the aftermath of severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. He said he sought emergency detox due to the prescribed dosage of clonazepam being increased after his wife was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He flew to Russia for treatment when unable to find North American doctors willing to accommodate him, and they diagnosed him with pneumonia in both lungs and had to place him in a medically induced coma for eight days. Then four weeks of intensive care followed in which he suffered temporary loss of some motor skills. He declared he was back to his normal self in June of 2020 in an announcement on his daughter's podcast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyru9GdmKdloJrBpr7SqKVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Jordan%20Peterson%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Peterson%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Peterson%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jordan%20Peterson%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjordan-peterson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Jordan%20Peterson%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mycuinfo-login-on-cu-boulder-employee-portal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MyCUinfo Login on CU Boulder Employee Portal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-tall-is-manny-montana-compared-to-his-castmates.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Tall Is Manny Montana Compared to His Castmates?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

They suspected her whole team might be dirty as well. It was rather unfortunate for the team because they didn’t start to put the pieces together until after they left themselves exposed. They told Adams all about their plans. They told her where they were going to be. They also tried to arrest Adams and she didn’t want to go down without a fight. She pulled a gun on them. Both her and her driver were armed. They started to fire before Sam and Callen could draw their weapons. And they could have died if they had been anyone else.</p><p>Luckily, they weren’t anyone else. They were highly skilled field agents for a reason. They immediately clocked Adam’s weapon. They knew when she would run out of juice and they used that time wisely. They got to their guns. They quickly neutralized the pair shooting at them. Then they tried figuring out what was going on. It was Adams who came to them to investigate one of her people. She told them some story about how she wasn’t sure if one of her own men was dirty or not. They agreed to assist her and that’s how they came to learn she was dirty.</p><p>It didn’t make sense why she would involve them if she was a part of the con. Callen believes it was because she wanted to look for a scapegoat if everything fell through. She could have been planning on blaming ATF Agent William Newsome for her own crimes or they were in it together and she was betraying him to get a bigger payday. They couldn’t really ask Adams herself because she was no longer going to be a problem. Which left them to worry about Newsome. Was he clean or was he dirty? The team didn’t know and they needed to find out fast because two of their own could be in jeopardy.</p><p>Kensi and Deeks were assigned to babysit Newsome. They were assigned before they found out about Adams. They knew that there was a chance that Newsome could be untrustworthy and they told him that they would be watching over him from a cliffside. After the thing with Adams happened, Kensi and Deeks had to wonder if they were safe. They decided to move from their position to stage some cameras at the scene. They wanted to maintain a closer eye on Newsome. Admiral Killbride found out they came up with their plan and he ordered them back into position.</p><p>The Admiral was strict on following the rules. He wasn’t like the others that have tried to lead this team. He was by the book because that was the only way to keep everyone safe. Admiral Killbride didn’t like that they came up with their own plan, but he was willing to work with them to form a new plan. One that wouldn’t leave them exposed. The Admiral had them breach the house to check on Newsome. Newsome could have walked into a trap for all they know and so it was perfectly alright that they perform search and rescue.</p><p>It ended up blowing Newsome’s cover. He was one of the good guys. He actually was investigating a group for the illegal smuggling of American missiles. The missiles were being stolen from a base in Argentina. Newsome was supposed to find the weapons. The problem was that he was a bit of a lone wolf. He didn’t want to wear an earpiece or any kind of device that would tell them what’s going on inside of the house. Kensi and Deeks going in was pretty reasonable in such a case because they truly had no idea what was going on. And the team got lucky again when Newsome turned out to be one of the good guys.</p><p>Newsome assisted NCIS in taking down these people that stole the weapons. He later told them that he didn’t need help or a team and so he was back to being a lone wolf. It was a good thing because everyone he works for or with had needed to be investigated. Also, Callen and Sam got help from Nina Barnes to find out how the weapons were getting stateside. They got their information and the whole thing made Callen realize that he doesn’t want a big wedding. Or the headache that comes with it. He wants to marry Ana as fast as possible and so he later asked her to elope.</p><p>Ana was being driven crazy by their wedding band cancelling on top of the caterers ghosting her. Her dad and his plus two invite were impossible to seat on a sitting chart and so eloping sounded like a great idea. It’s not like the team had great track records with weddings. Kensi and Deeks’s wedding being the last for a reason. Those two were getting dressed for the elopement when they found out that Kensi was pregnant. They were having a baby and the whole family was happy. It was a miracle because Kensi was told she would never have a baby naturally and yet that’s what happened.</p><p>They just have to keep the news a secret until Kensi passes the first trimester. They were sitting on this explosive news when they went down to City Hall and supported Callen on his big day. Only they weren’t the only ones with news. Roundtree found out that the LAPD were willing to pay him a settlement for macing him while he was unarmed and in handcuffs. This settlement would pay for the rest of his sister’s schooling. It would also mean they have a nest egg to fall back on in case anything were to happen. Roundtree was thinking of taking them up on the offer.</p><p>Callen and Ana were later married in front of their loved ones. Hetty missed it, but she sent him a letter telling him how she much she loves him and congratulating him on his wedding day. She also invited both him and Sam to Morocco where they ran into Nell. Sabatino was there. Neil was there. There was a new guy and so whatever Nell had planned or trouble Hetty was in – it was going to be a wild ride.</p><p>THE END</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnnpi2tHnLqKpmmZ6csq2x0maqnqqZmsBussinmKWdXaeypK3PZmduZWJmenN%2FjKycmqufo3pygIyep6Krn5mybn6QZqWer12Xsqi1zaegp5%2BjYr2ivtNmq7CnXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html&text=NCIS%3a%20Los%20Angeles%20Series%20Finale%20Recap%2005%2f21%2f23%3a%20Season%2014%20Episode%2021%20New%20Beginnings%2c%20Part%20Two&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html&title=NCIS%3a%20Los%20Angeles%20Series%20Finale%20Recap%2005%2f21%2f23%3a%20Season%2014%20Episode%2021%20New%20Beginnings%2c%20Part%20Two" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html&title=NCIS%3a%20Los%20Angeles%20Series%20Finale%20Recap%2005%2f21%2f23%3a%20Season%2014%20Episode%2021%20New%20Beginnings%2c%20Part%20Two" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html&title=NCIS%3a%20Los%20Angeles%20Series%20Finale%20Recap%2005%2f21%2f23%3a%20Season%2014%20Episode%2021%20New%20Beginnings%2c%20Part%20Two" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fncis-los-angeles-series-finale-recap-05-21-23-season-14-episode-21-new-beginnings-part-two.html&description=NCIS%3a%20Los%20Angeles%20Series%20Finale%20Recap%2005%2f21%2f23%3a%20Season%2014%20Episode%2021%20New%20Beginnings%2c%20Part%20Two" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-wonder-years-star-danica-mckellar-s-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is 'The Wonder Years' Star Danica McKellar's Ethnicity?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./matt-williams-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt Williams Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

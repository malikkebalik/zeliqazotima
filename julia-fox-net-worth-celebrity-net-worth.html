Julia Fox had her career breakthrough in 2019, when she made her film acting debut opposite <a href=#>Adam Sandler</a> in the acclaimed crime thriller "Uncut Gems." Since then, she has appeared in such films as "Puppet," "PVT Chat," and "No Sudden Move." In early 2022 Julia became notable for briefly dating rapper <a href=#>Kanye West</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Julia Fox was born on February 2, 1990 in Milan, Italy to an American father and an Italian mother. During her early childhood, she lived with her grandfather. When she was six, Fox moved with her father to New York City, where they lived in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan. As a teen, she attended City-As-School, and took a variety of service industry jobs in a shore store, pastry shop, and ice cream parlor. Additionally, Fox worked as a dominatrix for six months.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Fox began her professional career as a clothing designer. With her friend Briana Andalore, she created a successful line of women's knitwear called Franziska Fox. Additionally, Fox worked as a model, and posed for the final nude edition of Playboy in 2015.</p><p>Among her other early work, Fox was significantly involved in painting and photography. She self-published two photography books, "Symptomatic of a Relationship Gone Sour: Heartburn/Nausea" and "PTSD," which were released in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, Fox exhibited her paintings at an exhibit called "R.I.P. Julia Fox," where she displayed silk canvases smeared with her own blood. Together, these projects were intended to highlight thorny topics such as drug use and domestic violence, with which Fox had first-hand experience growing up.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-329041 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Julia-Fox.jpg alt="Julia Fox Net Worth" width=900 height=575 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-329041 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=8220uncut-gems8221-breakthrough><strong>"Uncut Gems" Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>Fox achieved her career breakthrough in 2019, when she made her film acting debut in the crime thriller "Uncut Gems," directed by brothers Josh and Benny Safdie.

Out of 200 actresses auditioned for the role, Fox was the one to land the part of Julia De Fiore, a brash saleswoman and the mistress of the film's main character, jewelry dealer and gambling addict Howard Ratner, played by Adam Sandler. She received a great deal of praise for her performance, as well as a number of citations from critics' groups, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination from the Toronto Film Critics Association.</p><h2 id=further-film-career><strong>Further Film Career</strong></h2><p>Following the success of "Uncut Gems," Fox appeared in two 2020 films: "Puppet" and "PVT Chat."

Just before giving birth to her son, Fox did a series of glamorous pregnancy photo-shoots she posted on her Instagram page.</p><p>On July 31, 2020, Fox participated in "Acting for a Cause," a series in which classic plays and screenplays are read live by a cast of actors.

Alan Menken earned his net worth by composing notable musicals for <a href=# title="Walt Disney Net Worth">Walt Disney</a>, including "The Little Mermaid" (1989), "Beauty and the Beast" (1991), and "Aladdin" (1992), and he is only the 16th person to win an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.</p><p>Alan has had success on Broadway as the composer for "Beauty and the Beast" (1994), "King David" (1997), "Little Shop of Horrors" (2003), "The Little Mermaid" (2008), "Sister Act" (2011), "Newsies" (2012), "Leap of Faith" (2012), "Aladdin" (2014), and "A Bronx Tale" (2016), and "Newsies" earned him a Tony for Best Original Score. Menken's biggest financial success has come from working with Disney. Over the last several decades, he composed music for movies such as "Pocahontas" (1995), "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1996), "Hercules" (1997), "Tangled" (2010), "Captain America: The First Avenger" (2011), and "Ralph Breaks the Internet" (2018). During his career Menken has won 11 Grammys, eight Academy Awards, and seven Golden Globes, among many other awards.</p><h2 id=earnings><strong>Earnings</strong></h2><p>His fee for one movie is typically $2â€“4 million, and every year his ASCAP royalties come in at around $5â€“10 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Alan Menken was born Alan Irwin Menken on July 22, 1949, in Manhattan, New York City. His mother, Judith, was a dancer, actress, and playwright, and his father, Norman, was a "boogie-woogie piano-playing dentist." According to his official website, Alan "grew up in a home, filled with music and theater (and comedy and drama)" with sisters Leah and Faye. Menken comes from a Jewish family, and he began taking violin and piano lessons as a child. Around this time, he started composing, and when he was 9 years old, he competed in the New York Federation of Music Clubs Junior Composers Contest; the judges rated his composition "Bouree" Superior and Excellent. Alan studied at New Rochelle High School, and after graduating in 1967, he earned a musicology degree from New York University's Steinhardt School in 1971. Menken then joined the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While showcasing numerous BMI workshop musicals in the '70s, Alan also worked "as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for 'Sesame Street' and a vocal coach." In the late '70s, playwright Howard Ashman recruited Menken to write the music for the musical "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater," an adaptation of the 1975 <a href=# title="Kurt Vonnegut Net Worth">Kurt Vonnegut</a> novel "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine." The musical received great reviews after its 1979 opening, and Menken and Ashman soon collaborated on the 1982 musical "Little Shop of Horrors," which set a box office record for the highest-grossing Off-Broadway play in history. "Little Shop of Horrors" was adapted into a 1986 film starring <a href=# title="Rick Moranis Net Worth">Rick Moranis</a>, <a href=# title="Steve Martin Net Worth">Steve Martin</a>, and Ellen Greene, which earned Alan and Howard their first Academy Award nomination. In 1983, Menken was honored with the BMI Career Achievement Award.

Alan won two Academy Awards for his work on the film, a feat he also accomplished with 1991's "Beauty and the Beast," 1992's "Aladdin," and 1995's "Pocahontas."

The manga, written by Hajime Isayama, immediately became favored among fans of the shonen genre from the get-go. Bringing a unique concept onto the table, Attack on Titan introduced the colossal giants as antagonists and allies alike, while comprising a panoply of singular characters to its idiosyncratic plot. With an assortment of qualities attached to this title, Attack on Titan is undoubtedly one of the most popular and successful anime in the world today.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=715 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Introducing the trio that leads the series — Eren, Mikasa, and Armin — Attack on Titan revolves around a world that has been taken over by uncanny and mysterious figures called titans. They are gigantic human-like, lanky figures capable of mass destruction, but most of all, their mysterious existence proves perhaps the most daunting part of all. Over the course of the anime, the titans’ existence is broken down slowly, as the series introduces yet another of its highly beloved characters: Levi Ackerman. Strong, short, and with a cold demeanor, Levi quickly became a fan favorite for his role as captain of the Special Operations Squad within the Survey Corps and humanity’s strongest soldier.</p><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>Over time, more and more fans have noticed similarities between these two characters in the Attack on Titan universe. Mikasa Ackerman and Levi Ackerman not only share the same surname, but their fighting styles are eerily similar, becoming two of the strongest non-titan characters on the show. These uncanny similarities have led the audience to believe that they are related. However, Isayama has never confirmed the family ties between the two Ackermans. As per some eagle-eyed fans, it appears that these two agile fighters may have a lot more in common than what meets the eye.</p><h2 id=h-the-story-of-the-ackermans data-injectable=false>The story of the Ackermans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/attack-on-titan-levi.png><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>The Ackerman clan — now continued by its remaining two members, Levi and Mikasa — was an Eldian family living within the walls. Introduced with Mikasa and her parents (with her mom as the only remaining Asian within the walls), the young girl eventually lost her parents to the titans, thus becoming the only Eurasian character on the show, as well as the only Ackerman until the introduction of Levi.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Both Mikasa and Levi are known for being fierce warriors, with their agility and quick wit in battle making them indispensable key elements in the fight against the Fritz ideology. Moreover, their strong assets are no coincidence. The Ackerman’s descent roots in the bloodline of warriors that protected Eldia’s king, which was then wiped out for the clan’s refusal to follow the Fritz ideology.</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>According to chapter 112 in the Attack on Titan manga, the Ackermans were subject to an experiment between subjects of Ymir and titan science. Later, the manga was confirmed that Mikasa and Levi have an awakened ability that can manifest the power of the titans as humans, without becoming a titan or inheriting any of the Nine Titans. For this reason, they are much stronger than the average human. In addition to this power, the awakened ability allows the two remaining members of the family to regain the battle experience from ancestral Ackermans.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>The only known members of the family in the story are Levi’s uncle, Kenny Ackerman, and his mother, Kuchel Ackerman along with his grandfather. From Mikasa’s side, only her parents are known. Despite no other Ackermans having been introduced, some fans have easily made the connection that tied Mikasa and Levi together, although a lot of information went amiss.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How are Mikasa and Levi related?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/attack-on-titan-ackerman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mikasa-levi-attack-on-titan-1.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Fans online have taken a detour from the main plot to expand a tad bit more on the unknown ties that complete the Ackerman family tree. In a fanmade genealogy graphic, the known members of Mikasa and Levi’s sides of the family have been drawn out. While it is not known exactly how their families are connected, the two Ackerman warriors are likely second-cousins, more specifically.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>While they undoubtedly share the same ancestry, there are absolutely no hints as to their closest connection in the family. The oldest member introduced was Levi’s grandfather, who fathered Kenny and Kuchel. As for Mikasa’s family, no older generations have ever been introduced other than her parents prior to their passing, meaning that a grandfather link may not be very likely, though it is possible.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Though most of this theory comes from fan speculation, Mikasa and Levi are surely long-lost cousins. Neither of them has ever questioned their ancestry, as most of the knowledge let on regarding the Ackerman bloodline was fabricated by Eren. It was never concluded whether the information was true or not. On top of that, it is also not known whether the Ackermans are predisposed to protect their leaders or if Levi and Mikasa simply have a high moral duty to the ones they serve.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>Attack on Titan‘s first seasons are available to watch on Crunchyroll, and the newest episode will drop on March 3 on the streaming platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6aqZ5lnZ64or%2FAZpinnF2hsre1jKucpZmkmrFutc1mmK2skZi4brvNZquirJGjfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html&text=Are%20Mikasa%20and%20Levi%20related%20in%20Attack%20on%20Titan%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html&title=Are%20Mikasa%20and%20Levi%20related%20in%20Attack%20on%20Titan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html&title=Are%20Mikasa%20and%20Levi%20related%20in%20Attack%20on%20Titan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html&title=Are%20Mikasa%20and%20Levi%20related%20in%20Attack%20on%20Titan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-mikasa-and-levi-related-in-attack-on-titan.html&description=Are%20Mikasa%20and%20Levi%20related%20in%20Attack%20on%20Titan%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brett-ratner-reportedly-on-verge-of-losing-450-million-warner-brothers-deal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brett Ratner Reportedly On Verge Of Losing $450 Million Warner Brothers Deal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./an-ex-james-bond-joins-the-cast-of-yellowstone-prequel-1923.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="An ex-James Bond joins the cast of Yellowstone prequel 1923">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Judith Tai Raanan and Natalie were in Nahal Oz, a small village near the Gaza Strip, when Hamas invaded and destroyed it on October 7, 2023.</p><p>Both mother and daughter, visitors from the Chicago area, spent time with family in Israel when this distressing event occurred. Sadly, they are now counted among the missing Americans and are feared to have been kidnapped by Hamas terrorists.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Natalie Raanan mother Judith Tai Raanan" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Natalie-Raanan-mother-Judith-Tai-Raanan.webp alt="Natalie Raanan mother Judith Tai Raanan" width=400 height=496 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Judith’s brother and Natalie’s father have not received any communication from the duo. They are deeply concerned that they may have been abducted by the terrorists, especially given the alarming video and images depicting Hamas kidnapping women during their coordinated assault.</p><p>The family maintains communication with the U.S. Embassy, actively working to ascertain the current status of reported missing Americans in Israel.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Natalie Raanan and Her Mother Judith Raanan" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Natalie-Raanan-and-Her-Mother-Judith-Raanan.webp alt="Natalie Raanan and Her Mother Judith Raanan" width=400 height=446 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Where was Natalie Raanan Last Seen?</strong></h2><p>Judith and her daughter Natalie Raanan, who were visiting Israel, are currently missing. Concern grips their family as they suspect Hamas militants may have taken them.</p><p>There has been no communication from the mother and daughter duo since approximately noon on Saturday, the day Hamas initiated its offensive, as per family accounts.</p><p>Their last known location was Nahal Oz, a kibbutz situated about 1.5 miles from the Gaza border, which unfortunately fell victim to the attack by militants. These two U.S. citizens arrived in Israel in early September, intending to celebrate the High Holidays and spend time with relatives, as shared by the family.</p><p>The relatives emphasize their desire for the United States government to utilize all available resources to ensure the safe return of Judith and Natalie.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Natalie Raanan and Her Mother Released by Hamas" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Natalie-Raanan-and-Her-Mother-Released-by-Hamas.webp alt="Natalie Raanan and Her Mother Released by Hamas" width=400 height=439 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Natalie Raanan and Her Mother Released by Hamas</strong></h2><p>Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, were held captive by a group called Hamas in Israel on october 7, 2023. But now, they are safe and back with their community.</p><p>They were released and brought to safety by a group called the International Committee of the Red Cross. The U.S. government confirmed their release, and even President Joe Biden spoke about how tough their experience was.</p><p>Natalie’s dad, Uri Raanan, expressed his relief and joy about his daughter’s release. He can’t wait to hug and kiss her, especially since her birthday is coming up. Waiting to hear about his daughter’s whereabouts was really hard for him, and he couldn’t sleep well during those two weeks.</p><p>While they are safe now, we don’t know exactly when they will return to Evanston. Their son, Ben Raanan, mentioned that it depends on the hospitals and making sure they are physically and mentally okay before they come back.</p><p>Hamas, the group that held them, said they released the mother and daughter because of an agreement with officials from Qatar. The Israeli Defense Forces are checking on their health to make sure they are okay.</p><p>These two women are the first to be released among more than 200 people who were held by Hamas. President Biden talked to them and promised that the U.S. government will support them in their recovery.</p><p>The details of how they were released are a bit complicated, and the U.S. government is not sharing everything because there are still other people held by Hamas. But it’s clear that Qatar played an important role in helping them get released.</p><p>The most important thing is that the Evanston mother and daughter are safe now, and we hope they can return to their home soon. This whole situation has been really tough for them and their family, and we’re relieved they are out of danger.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Kim Damti Wiki, Age, Parents, Siblings, Boyfriend and More</a></p><h2><strong>US Embassy Preparing to Bring Back Americans From Israel</strong></h2><p>The United States strongly condemns the heinous attack by Hamas on Israel and has affirmed its unwavering support for Israel during this challenging period.</p><p>Lloyd Austin, the American Defense Secretary, has ordered the Ford carrier strike group to set sail to the Eastern Mediterranean, prepared to assist Israel.</p><p>This deployment, involving an array of ships and warplanes, underscores the deep concern of the United States in preventing the escalation of the conflict.</p><p>Initial reports suggest that a minimum of four U.S. citizens lost their lives in these attacks, with an additional seven individuals still unaccounted for, as confirmed by a U.S. official.</p><p>In response, the U.S. embassy in Cairo has advised Americans in the region to exercise caution, recognizing the potential connection between the attack and the ongoing tensions between Israel and Palestinian militants.</p><h2><strong>Natalie Raanan Graduated From Deerfield High School</strong></h2><p>2005 Natalie Raanan (age 18) was born in Illinois, United States.

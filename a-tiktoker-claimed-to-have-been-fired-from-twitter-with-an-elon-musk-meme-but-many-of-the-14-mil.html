Shaver said. "I think it makes a big statement about Elon Musk, and how he's publicly perceived, that people were willing to believe this is something that he or someone under him would do."</p><p>Twitter laid off roughly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>3,700 employees</a> on November 4, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>shortly after Musk took over</a>. Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary called the mass layoff a "<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>good case study</a>" for MBA programs on "how not to fire people."</p><p>Shaver estimated to Insider that about 80% of the comments came from people who mistook the satire as fact, and about 20% from users who understood the video was a joke.</p><p>Shaver told Insider he didn't want to explicitly correct confused viewers because that would "ruin the joke," so, instead, he filmed a part two and three — each one, by his description, growing increasingly absurd.</p><p>In part two, published on <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>November 5</a>, Shaver told viewers he was responsible for building a Twitter feature that doesn't exist — something that shows you an Elon Musk tweet every time you open the app — and included another doctored meme with the text: "a little bird told me… cease and desist." In part three, published on <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>November 8</a>, he told viewers he was being invited back (some Twitter employees have, in actuality, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>been offered their jobs back</a>) and another fake meme, with the text: "don't take flight, come home to roost."</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The second fake meme Shaver told viewers he'd been sent from Twitter. After viewers mistook the video as factual, Shaver said he tried to increase the absurdity of his follow-up videos. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>TikTok;@mattxshaver</span></span></figure><p>And still, he said, people seemed to believe him. In part, Shaver said, because it seemed like people weren't watching the entire videos, while others were using what he'd jokingly said to reinforce their existing beliefs about Musk, tech, and American politics.</p><p>Shaver said among the majority who believed the video to be factual, about 25% of commenters posted kind messages; he said tech recruiters got in touch and TikTokers tagged him in videos from lawyers interested in a class action lawsuit. The rest, he said, were negative.</p><p>For Shaver, who said he wanted to find the "knife's edge" between absurdity and reality, the confusion was actually the mark of a job well done.</p><p>This isn't the first time a satirical TikTok has gone mega-viral and duped many. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>In September, a 22-year-old convinced millions that he was actually AI</a> in a TikTok viewed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>25.5 million times</a>. In early October, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>TikTok of a Photoshop-enlarged frog managed to confuse millions of viewers.</a></p><p>Social media isn't conducive to consistent fact checks, and TikTok's algorithm gives viewers even less context for the content they consume and the creators that make it than apps like Instagram and Twitter. The FYP, ruled by a mysterious algorithm, regularly shows users videos from strangers they don't follow. Shaver said he had about 100,000 followers when he posted the video. Of the 14 million views his Musk meme video recieved, many were likely engaging with Shaver's content for the first time. And, likely, many of them didn't go the extra step of checking out Shaver's profile, which is full of more recognizable comedic parodies.</p><p>For Shaver, being able to discern fact from fiction is a "shared responsibility" between tech companies and their users. Ultimately, he doesn't believe it's too difficult for viewers to discern what's real if they put in a little effort.</p><p>While he doesn't plan to explicitly correct TikTokers, he did take to Twitter to reveal the truth.</p><p>"It's insane to me how many people thought that they were real, and how many more people wanted them to be real so they had someone to hate (me or Elon Musk)," his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>November 7 tweet</a> reads in part.</p><p>Shaver was moved to issue the clarification after hearing that Musk was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link>banning accounts</a> that impersonated him.</p><p>"I'm not impersonating him," he explained to Insider, "but just to be safe."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!

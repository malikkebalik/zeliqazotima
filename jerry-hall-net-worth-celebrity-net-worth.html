Jerry Hall was one of the most popular models in the world in the 70s. She was discovered by a fashion agent while sunbathing in Saint Tropez. With her blonde hair and six foot height, she became one of the most popular models of her time, earning as much as a $1,000 per day in the early 1970s. She made her transition to acting in 1980 with a small part in the romance film "Urban Cowboy." Since then, Hall has appeared extensively on stage, acting in productions of such shows as "The Graduate," "High Society," and "Love Letters."</p><p>Jerry is probably better known for her romantic relationships. She became engaged to <a href=#>Bryan Ferry</a> in the mid-70s, but subsequently met <a href=#>Mick Jagger</a> and began a relationship with him. He would eventually leave his wife for her, and the pair had four children together before separating in 1999. In their divorce settlement, Mick claimed that their marriage was never official because the ceremony was informal. Jerry sought half of his $300 million net worth at the time but eventually settled for just $10 million.</p><p>In 2015 she began dating billionaire <a href=#>Rupert Murdoch</a>. They married in 2016.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jerry Hall was born on July 2, 1956 in Gonzales, Texas to John and medical records librarian Marjorie. She is of Irish, English, and Dutch ancestry, and is a descendant of Daniel Boone's friend Humphrey Best. Hall has a twin sister named Terry, as well as three older sisters, including Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Rosy. Growing up, Hall was raised in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, where she went to North Mesquite High School. While there, she also took classes at the Eastfield Campus of Dallas College in gymnastics, archery, and tennis. Hall graduated early at the age of 16.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings-in-modeling><strong>Career Beginnings in Modeling</strong></h2><p>While sunbathing on a Saint-Tropez beach in the French Riviera, Hall and her twin sister were spotted by fashion agent Claude Haddad, who was very impressed. Hall subsequently moved to Paris, where she shared an apartment with actress <a href=# title="Jessica Lange Net Worth">Jessica Lange</a> and singer <a href=# title="Grace Jones Net Worth">Grace Jones</a>. She went on to have her first major modeling gig in 1975, appearing as the titular mythical figure on the cover of the Roxy Music album "Siren." The album was a hit, and Hall's popularity blew up over the subsequent years. By 1977, she had appeared on 40 magazine covers, and was receiving modeling fees of over $1,000 a day. Thanks to her lustrous blonde hair and svelte six-foot frame, Hall became one of the most famous and prolifically photographed models of the era. Additionally, she served as a muse for such artists as Ed Ruscha, Francesco Clemente, and Lucian Freud, and often modeled for <a href=# title="Andy Warhol Net Worth">Andy Warhol</a>.</p><h2 id=acting-career><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Leveraging her huge popularity as a model, Hall transitioned to acting in 1980. That year, she had her first role in the romantic Western film "Urban Cowboy," starring <a href=# title="John Travolta Net Worth">John Travolta</a> and <a href=# title="Debra Winger Net Worth">Debra Winger</a>.

She continued to appear in several theatrical productions over the following years, with many in the UK and Ireland. In 2002, Hall was in the play "Picasso's Women" in Brighton. Three years later, she made her return to the West End to play Mother Lord in the first London production of Cole Porter's musical comedy "High Society." After a long break from television, Hall returned in 2005 to lend her voice to the British adult animated sitcom "Popetown"; she voiced the character Sister Penelope. Two years later, Hall guest-starred on the British series "Hotel Babylon," and after that, appeared on the British sketch comedy show "French and Saunders."

By the end of the series, she picked Seth Frye as the winner. Later, in 2012, Hall competed in the tenth season of the British television dance competition series "Strictly Come Dancing." Performing with her professional partner <a href=# title="Anton du Beke Net Worth">Anton du Beke</a>, she was the second celebrity to be eliminated from the show.

Two years later, she left him for Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, with whom she had four children between 1984 and 1997: Elizabeth, James, Georgia, and Gabriel. In 1990, Hall and Jagger held a Hindu wedding ceremony in Bali, Indonesia; however, the marriage was deemed null and void by the High Court of England and Wales nine years later, on account of it not being legal. Hall and Jagger resided at Downe House, Richmond Hill in Greater London. The pair eventually broke up in 1999 due to Jagger's infidelity. Later, in 2015, Hall began dating billionaire businessman Rupert Murdoch; they got married the following year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLemvtGyZKGZnKF6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Jerry%20Hall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jerry%20Hall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jerry%20Hall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Jerry%20Hall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerry-hall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Jerry%20Hall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./junkie-xl-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Junkie XL Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ismail-haniyeh-death-haniyah-s-house-bombed-14-killed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ismail Haniyeh Death, Haniyahs House Bombed 14 Killed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

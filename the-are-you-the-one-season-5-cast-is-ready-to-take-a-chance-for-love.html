The bold love experiment is back and better than ever, and there's also going to be a new twist this time around. So who's up to the task in finding love in one of the most unique dating shows to ever hit TV? The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Are You the One? Season 5 cast</a> is full of fierce competitors looking for their perfect match.</p><p>If you've heard of Are You the One?, you probably know that its part-dating show, part-reality competition. The basic premise of the series is that MTV casts a bunch of singles who go through a rigorous matchmaking process and an algorithm to find each cast member's "perfect match" among the bunch. If they find their so-called "perfect match" by the end of the season, the couple will split a cash prize of $1 million. Not to mention, the contestants supposedly found true love, so all in all, this sounds like a pretty sweet deal.</p><p>But what about that aforementioned new twist, you ask? Well, Are You the One? is adding an additional couple to the mix this season, which means that instead of the usual 10 couples, there will be 11 in this installment. Though that may seem like an insignificant change to the game, it'll actually make it more difficult for the contestants to find "the one," especially with the same 10 tries to find him or her.</p><p>So who are the brave souls willing to take on this whole new challenge? Get to know the contestants looking for love — and some money — this season of Are You the One?.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Alicia Wright</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Alicia is a 23-year-old studying to become a dentist while working at a veterinary hospital, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to her official cast bio</a>. <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Her love of animals is clear from her Insta</a>, which is filled with pics of pooches. She's also <a href=# rel=noreferrer>proud of her Puerto Rican</a> heritage. Alicia grew up more like a parent to her siblings, and all that responsibility has "left her with a head strong attitude that most guys can’t handle," her show bio says. Well, Alicia will have 11 dudes to test that theory out on throughout this show.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Andre Siemers</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Andre is trying to make a name for himself in the rap game, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio says</a>. In fact, he's already got some pretty <a href=# rel=noreferrer>profesh-looking music videos</a> out there in the world. You can also catch him <a href=# rel=noreferrer>making appearances at a club near you</a>, according to his Instagram profile. Now 21, Andre has owned his own company since he was 17 years old. But this Burnsville, Minnesota native is a self-proclaimed "good ol’ country boy who loves camping, hunting, and fishing," according to his show bio. But it's not going to be all fun and games for Andre this season of Are You the One? since his ex won't be too far from his thoughts. We'll have to wait and see if Andre is willing to open his heart again this season.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Carolina Duarte</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Casandra Martinez</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Derrick Henry</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Derrick sounds like one busy guy. He's described as a star college athlete working toward his MBA <a href=# rel=noreferrer>in his official show bio</a>. The 23-year-old from Charleston, South Carolina is not to be confused with the former Alabama running back and Heisman trophy winner though. This Derrick last played basketball for The Citadel and he now works as a leasing manager at a Charleston apartment complex, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to The Post and Courier</a>. Now Derrick is looking to settle down, so could he find his true love on Are You the One?.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Edward Williams</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Gianna Hammer</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Hannah Fugazzi</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Hayden Weaver</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Hayden hails from Anderson, Indiana, and since "he grew up on the edge of a cornfield," he's not the best with the ladies, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to his official show bio</a>. But it looks like the 23-year-old moved to San Francisco last summer for a "short-term move," which led to him joining the Season 5 cast of Are You the One?, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to his Instagram profile</a>. Also from that Insta profile, it seems like <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Hayden has a good sense of humor</a>. So that, coupled with his good looks, means that he's probably better at wooing potential dates than he thinks.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Jaylan Adlam</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Jaylan used to be a football player for Campbell University, and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio says</a> that people often think that he's still confident like a star athlete, too. But that's not the case as Jaylan still considers himself "nerdy" and "awkward" around women. The 23-year-old lives in Atlanta, Georgia these days, and he's keeping busy working on an athletic development and performance training program called <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Adapt, according to his Instagram profile</a>.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Joey Amoia</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Joey is from Tonawanda, New York, and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio describes him</a> as "an old school, blue collar, alpha male," so he should be quite entertaining to watch on screen. The 23-year-old says that he's working part-time as a sanitation worker in this preview for the new season, so he could really use the prize money. See? Joey is already very memorable.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Kam Williams</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Kam works as a flight attendant, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to her show bio</a>, so that means she never stays in one place for long (she's from Pennsauken, New Jersey), which is also not the best ingredient for a successful relationship. But Kam, 21, drops a lot of knowledge <a href=# rel=noreferrer>on her YouTube channel</a>, so she's clearly an expert in the life hacks department.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Kari Kowalski</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Kathryn Palmer</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Kathryn is from Tallahassee, Florida and considers herself a Southern Belle, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to her cast bio</a>. The 22-year-old seems like quite the fun-loving gal from her Instagram photos, which often feature her smiling. Unfortunately, Kathryn has a habit of falling for guys who harsh her mellow and not knowing when to let them go, her show bio says, so let's hope she learns how to let the good times roll on Are You the One?.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Michael Halpern</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Michael, 24, loves the thrill of the chase and always wants the women he can't have, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio describes</a>. Obviously, that's not a good approach when you're trying to find a mate. Perhaps <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his sister's recent wedding</a> will inspire the Tamarac, Florida native to get serious about love.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Mike Cerasani</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Remember GTL (Gym, Tan, Laundry) from Jersey Shore? Well, Staten Island, New York native Mike has a similar acronym that he's going to bring to Are You the One? audiences this season: <a href=# rel=noreferrer>HEAT (Haircut, Eyebrows, and a Tan)</a>. <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The guy has done some modeling</a>, so perhaps he does know what he's talking about in the looks department. But Mike, 25, does consider himself a player, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>according to his show bio</a>, so he could definitely use some help when it comes to love.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Osvaldo Romero</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Ozzy Morales</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Ozzy is originally from Costa Rica, but he left his home and gave up a promising soccer career there to move to the United States with his father, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio says</a>. This moving around has put a strain on Ozzy's relationships. The 24-year-old is living in Anaheim, California these days, but sometimes Ozzy returns to Costa Rica, and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>we get amazing pics like this</a>.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Shannon Duffy</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Taylor Selfridge</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Taylor is a teacher's aide living in Yacolt, Washington, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>her show bio says</a>. We'll have to wait and see if the 22-year-old found love on Are You the One?, but it definitely seems like she's found <a href=# rel=noreferrer>a bestie in fellow contestant, Hannah</a>. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of shenanigans these two get into this season.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Tyler O'Brien</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>Tyler is a model living in Boca Raton, Florida, but don't let that smile fool you. The 22-year-old had a tough upbringing in South Boston, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his show bio says</a>. He apparently adopted a "fake it 'til you make it" attitude, to help him get through it, which may have worked then but isn't such a good method when it comes to relationships. But Tyler does seem to show genuine enthusiasm for the things he really cares about, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>such as his family</a>, so that's something.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Tyranny Todd</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>MTV</p></figure><p>With a name like Tyranny, I'm expecting this chick to be a force to be reckoned with on Are You the One? this season. The 22-year-old from Augusta, Georgia does dream of ruling the courtroom one day as a judge,<a href=# rel=noreferrer> her cast bio</a> says. It looks like <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Tyranny used to work at Hooters</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>has done some modeling in the past</a>, according to her Instagram profile. Let's just hope Tyranny can learn to take control of her love life on Are You the One?.</p><p>Then again, isn't that what we should all be rooting for the entire cast to do this season?</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jq2fnmWRp7Juxc6uZK2glWK8r7GMrJyaq5%2BjenZ5wpqqrWWZqHqzscCdsGasn2LBorfEZphmm5iWu6SxjJ%2Bmq2WcpMOmeZFyaWpu</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html&text=The%20%27Are%20You%20The%20One%27%20Season%205%20Cast%20Is%20Ready%20To%20Take%20A%20Chance%20For%20Love&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html&title=The%20%27Are%20You%20The%20One%27%20Season%205%20Cast%20Is%20Ready%20To%20Take%20A%20Chance%20For%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html&title=The%20%27Are%20You%20The%20One%27%20Season%205%20Cast%20Is%20Ready%20To%20Take%20A%20Chance%20For%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html&title=The%20%27Are%20You%20The%20One%27%20Season%205%20Cast%20Is%20Ready%20To%20Take%20A%20Chance%20For%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-are-you-the-one-season-5-cast-is-ready-to-take-a-chance-for-love.html&description=The%20%27Are%20You%20The%20One%27%20Season%205%20Cast%20Is%20Ready%20To%20Take%20A%20Chance%20For%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-dark-side-of-celebrity-fashion-lines.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Dark Side Of Celebrity Fashion Lines">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./terry-lundgren-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terry Lundgren Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

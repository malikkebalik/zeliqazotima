Tiger Shroff is known for his work in Indian cinema. Among his most famous movies are "Heropanti," "War," and the films in the "Baaghi" action thriller series. Shroff's other credits include the superhero film "A Flying Jatt," the action drama "Munna Michael," and the teen romantic comedy sequel "Student of the Year 2."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Tiger Shroff was born as Jai Hemant Shroff on March 2, 1990 in what was then Bombay, India to film actor and former model <a href=#>Jackie Shroff</a> and film actress, producer, and former model Ayesha. He has a younger sister named Krishna. Shroff is of Gujarati and Turkmen descent on his father's side and of Bengali and Belgian descent on his mother's side. He was educated at the American School of Bombay.</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Shroff made his film debut in the 2014 romantic action film "Heropanti," directed by Sabbir Khan as a remake of the Telugu film "Parugu." He starred opposite <a href=# title="Kriti Sanon Net Worth">Kriti Sanon</a>, with Prakash Raj in a supporting role. "Heropanti" was a significant commercial hit, spawning a sequel. Shroff next starred in the 2016 action thriller "Baaghi," also directed by Sabbir Khan. A remake of the Telugu film "Varsham," it also stars Shraddha Kapoor and Sudheer Babu. "Baaghi" was another big commercial hit; it spawned two sequels. The same year he starred in the first "Baaghi," Shroff starred in the superhero film "A Flying Jatt" as a martial arts teacher who acquires superpowers. His costar was Jacqueline Fernandez. In 2017, Shroff reunited with director Sabbir Khan again for the action drama "Munna Michael," costarring Nidhhi Agerwal. Both "A Flying Jatt" and "Munna Michael" failed to make waves at the box office.</p><p>Shroff bounced back to success in 2018 with the smash sequel "Baaghi 2," one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of the year. He subsequently starred in two major movies in 2019. The first was the teen romantic comedy sequel "Student of the Year 2," in which he played a college student competing in an annual school championship. Shroff's biggest film of 2019, however, was the action thriller "War," in which he starred alongside <a href=# title="Hrithik Roshan Net Worth">Hrithik Roshan</a>. The film was a phenomenon, setting records and becoming the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year and one of the highest-grossing Indian films in history. Shroff next starred in "Baaghi 3," which was another smash hit for him. Far less successful was "Heropanti 2," which flopped upon its release in 2022. Among Shroff's other credits is the action thriller "Ganapath," which reunites him with actress Kriti Sanon.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-328190 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tiger-Shroff.jpg alt="Tiger Shroff Net Worth" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-328190 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by SUJIT JAISWAL/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Outside of the cinema, Shroff has appeared in an array of music videos for other artists. In 2015, he was in the videos for Arijit Singh's "Chal Wahan Jaate Hain" and Atif Aslam's hit song "Zindagi Aa Raha Hoon Main." The following year, Shroff appeared in the video for "Befikra" by Meet Bros and Aditi Singh Sharma. He has also appeared in the music videos for Benny Dayal's "Are You Coming" and "I Am a Disco Dancer 2.0."</p><h2 id=brand-ambassadorships><strong>Brand Ambassadorships</strong></h2><p>Due to his growing prominence in Indian cinema, Shroff has been recruited as an ambassador for various brands. In 2017, he became a brand ambassador and co-owner of the Bengaluru Tigers, a mixed martial arts team. The Tigers claimed third place in the inaugural Super Fight League in India. Shroff went on to become a brand ambassador for Prowl, Pepsi, Macho, Forca, and Garnier, among many other brands.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>A Hindu devotee of Lord Shiva, Shroff has credited his ripped physique to the deity. Every Monday and during every Maha Shivaratri festival, he holds a fast.</p><p>In 2014, Shroff earned an honorary fifth degree black belt in Taekwondo. Because he is a skilled martial artist, he often helps other actors train for action films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMGqs8SrZKygoqSzp3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Tiger%20Shroff%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Tiger%20Shroff%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Tiger%20Shroff%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Tiger%20Shroff%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftiger-shroff-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Tiger%20Shroff%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anthony-mackie-admits-he-s-upset-sebastian-stan-isn-t-in-captain-america-new-world-order.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anthony Mackie admits hes upset Sebastian Stan isnt in Captain America: New World Order">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./naveen-jain-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Naveen Jain Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

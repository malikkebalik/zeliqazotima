Freddie Freeman is a first baseman who bats left handed and throws right handed. He played at El Modena High School then signed a letter of intent with Cal State Fullerton but was drafted #78 overall by the Atlanta Braves in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut for the Braves in 2010. Freddie Freeman signed an eight year deal with the Braves for $135 million in 2014. He ultimately played 11 seasons with the Braves before being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He signed a six-year, $162 million contract with the Dodgers in March of 2022.Among his other achievements, Freeman has won multiple Silver Slugger Awards.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Freddie Freeman was born on September 12, 1989 in Fountain Valley, California to Canadian parents Rosemary and Fredrick. He has two older brothers named Andrew and Phillip. When Freeman was 10, his mother passed away.</p><p>Freeman grew up playing baseball on youth teams. He was educated at El Modena High School, where he played as a third baseman and pitcher on the school baseball team. As a senior in 2007, he was named the player of the year by the Orange County Register. Freeman intended to go on to play baseball at California State University, Fullerton, but entered the MLB draft instead.</p><h2 id=minor-league-career><strong>Minor League Career</strong></h2><p>In the 2007 MLB draft, Freeman was chosen in the second round by the Atlanta Braves. He made his debut in the team's minor league system with the Gulf Coast Braves, and after that played for the Rome Braves. Starting the 2009 season, Freeman played for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans. During the season, he was promoted to the Mississippi Braves. After the end of the 2009 season, Freeman joined the Arizona Fall League's Peoria Saguaros. He subsequently played for the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International League for the start of the 2010 season.</p><h2 id=atlanta-braves><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></h2><p>On the first day of September in 2010, Freeman was called up to the Atlanta Braves. He made his MLB debut the same day. Four days later, he scored his first career MLB hit in a game against the Florida Marlins. Freeman's first MLB home run came a few weeks later in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Toward the end of the season, he returned to the Arizona Fall League to play for the Phoenix Desert Dogs. Back with the Braves in 2011, Freeman became the team's starting first baseman. He had his best season yet in July, winning NL Rookie of the Month honors. Freeman finished the season batting .282 with 21 home runs. In 2012, he posted a .259 batting average with 23 home runs, and in 2013 finished with a .319 batting average and another 23 home runs. Freeman signed an eight-year extension with the Braves in early 2014. He went on to have a great season, leading the team in batting average and setting a franchise record for innings played. Freeman's 2015 season was less strong, as he spent much of it on the disabled list due to a recurring wrist injury.</p><p>Although he got off to a rocky start in the 2016 season, Freeman eventually improved. In June, he hit his first career cycle, and was named NL Player of the Week. Freeman also posted his first 30-home run season in 2016, which he achieved in September. He finished the season batting .302 with 34 home runs. In the 2017 season, Freeman played fewer games due to injury, but still managed to lead the Braves in batting average (.307) and home runs (28). He led the team in several more categories in 2018, including RBIs, with 98. For his season, Freeman won the Gold Glove Award. He went on to win the Silver Slugger Award in 2019, and then another in the shortened 2020 season, when he was also named the NL MVP. Freeman claimed a third consecutive Silver Slugger in 2021. That year, he helped lead the Braves to victory over the Houston Astros in the World Series, winning in six games.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289657 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Freddie-Freeman.jpg alt="Freddie Freeman" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289657 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=free-agency><strong>Free Agency</strong></h2><p>Following his World Series victory with the Braves, Freeman became a free agent. The Braves made a series of offers to retain him, but Freeman and his agent couldn't reach an agreement with the team, and their proposals were rejected. When the Athletics' Matt Olson was acquired by the Braves in early 2022, Freeman's tenure with the team officially ended.</p><h2 id=los-angeles-dodgers><strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></h2><p>Having had his contract proposal turned down by the Braves, Freeman chose to return to his home in Southern California and sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He signed a six-year, $162 million contract with the team in March of 2022. Freeman made his debut as a Dodger in April, going 1-3 with a walk against the Colorado Rockies. A couple weeks later, in a game against his former team, he hit his first home run as a Dodger. In his 159 total games in 2022, Freeman led the MLB with 199 hits and 47 doubles.</p><h2 id=traffic-jam-incident><strong>Traffic Jam Incident</strong></h2><p>During the January 2014 Gulf Coast winter storm, Freeman was stuck in an unmoving traffic jam. After hours trapped in his vehicle, he was finally rescued by his former Braves teammate <a href=#>Chipper Jones</a>, who showed up on his ATV. In response to the incident, the Braves later created a "Chipper Rescues Freddie" bobblehead for the 2016 baseball season.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Freeman wed Chelsea Goff. Together, they have three sons: Charlie, Brandon, and Maximus.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In January 2019, Freddie and Chelsea paid $10 million for a home in Corona Del Mar, California.</p><p>In March 2023, Freddie and Chelsea paid $7.8 million for a home in Studio City, California.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2ieopqxpbXEZp2rnZWirq95zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Freddie%20Freeman%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Freddie%20Freeman%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Freddie%20Freeman%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Freddie%20Freeman%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddie-freeman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Freddie%20Freeman%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./go-behind-the-scenes-of-the-great-70s-movie-musicals-barbra-streisand-to-rocky-horror.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Go Behind the Scenes of the Great 70s Movie Musicals: Barbra Streisand to Rocky Horror, ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danny-lloyd-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Lloyd Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

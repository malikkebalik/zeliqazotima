Conversely, in Chapter 27, the young actor gained 67 pounds and is hardly recognizable as John Lennon’s killer, Mark David Chapman. And in his breakthrough movie, Requiem for a Dream, Leto lost 28 pounds, lived on the streets of New York City, and abstained from sex to make his “onscreen cravings” as a heroin addict “that much more realistic.”</p><p id=par-7_56>Some might consider Leto’s acting methods bizarre, but&nbsp;<a href=#>Leto is a bit of an odd duck</a>&nbsp;in real life, too. He has a reputation for going to the extremes in other areas, such as segregating himself from the world during the COVID-19 pandemic for a meditation retreat. And he once lived on a former Air Force base.</p><p id=par-8_18>To many, he seems unusual.

Despite his success as an actor, musician, and financial investor, he didn’t have the rosy childhood you might think. And it might be his upbringing and childhood that makes him such a powerful performer today.</p><p id=par-10_32>Leto’s father walked out on the family when the Morbius star was only 8, leaving him, his brother Shannon, and his mom Constance to live a “dirt poor” existence, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;reports.</p><p id=par-11_51>The small family survived as best they could, without a TV and with the assistance of food stamps. At one point, when Leto was 10, they lived in a commune in Colorado. Altogether, Leto lived in Louisiana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Virginia throughout his childhood. He even spent 18 months in Haiti.</p><h2 id=h-an-unparalleled-rise-to-stardom>An unparalleled rise to stardom</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_53>Despite his childhood hardships and nomadic experiences, Leto has overcome adversity. He is not only a successful actor with a net worth of roughly $90 million, but he also continues to perfect his craft and land pivotal roles that will no doubt make him an onscreen legend. But&nbsp;<a href=#>Jared Leto doesn’t just make movies</a>.</p><p id=par-13_35>He tapped his brother Shannon to pursue their lifelong dream of starting a band. The two formed 30 Seconds to Mars and play to sold-out shows worldwide. The group has sold over 10 million albums.</p><p id=par-14_26>It’s hard to find an actor who’s risen to&nbsp;<a href=#>fame the way Jared Leto</a>&nbsp;has.

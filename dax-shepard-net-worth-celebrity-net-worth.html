That is a combined net worth with <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a>, his wife since 2013. Dax Shepard shot to fame with his appearance in MTV's Punk'd, but later became well-known for his acting roles and stand-up routines. Of late, Dax is probably best known for his highly-successful podcast Armchair Expert. He and Kristen appear in many commercials together and they co-founded a baby product company called Hello Bello, which unfortunately filed for bankruptcy in October 2023.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Dax Randall Shepard was born on January 2nd of 1975 in in a suburb of Detroit. His parents divorced when he was just two, leaving his mother to raise him as a single parent. However, Shepard's mother rose to the challenge, becoming a successful entrepreneur by the time Dax was in high school. She eventually worked in public relations for General Motors, and her work frequently involved heading to racetracks. As a teen, Dax would work for his mother and join her at the racetracks. At one point, his stepfather was an engineer for the Corvette. Dax has had three stepfathers, as his mother has been married four times.</p><p>Although Dax moved around a lot as a child, he graduated from high school in Detroit in 1993. Dax has stated that he was the class clown while in school and that he was initially more interested in doing stand-up than acting. Eventually, he struck a deal with his mother: if she paid his rent, he would go to college. After attending a comedy sketch school, he attended UCLA where he graduated with a degree in anthropology. Moving to Los Angeles gave him the push he needed to try stand-up comedy for the first time, as he was too scared to give it a shot in Detroit.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296668 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Dax-Shepard-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 2228px) 100vw, 2228px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296668 class=wp-caption-text>Amy Sussman/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Dax Shepard's five years of training as a comedian proved to be useful, as he later landed a role in MTV's "Punk'd" in 2003.

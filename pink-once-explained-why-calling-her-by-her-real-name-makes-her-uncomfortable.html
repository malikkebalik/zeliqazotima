The alias was inspired by an embarrassing incident she experienced as a child. But it was also perpetrated in part by a well-known Quentin Tarantino movie.</p><p id=par-3_72>“It’s just a nickname that’s been following me my whole life. It was a mean thing at first; some kids at camp pulled my pants down and I blushed so much, and they were like, ‘Ha ha! Look at her! She’s pink!’ And then the <a href=#>movie Reservoir Dogs came out</a>-and Mr. Pink was the one with the smart mouth, so it just happened all over again,” she once told CNN (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pink-was-uncomfortable-with-people-calling-her-by-her-real-name>Pink was uncomfortable with people calling her by her real name</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_53>Pink eventually grew from a nickname to a household name. <a href=#>The singer became a successful artist</a> in her own right, selling millions of albums worldwide and earning several accolades. But because of her growing fame, her friends stopped addressing her as Pink. Now her real name, Alecia, is seen as her personal nickname.</p><p id=par-5_49>“All my friends have pretty much reverted back to Alecia because the world has claimed Pink. It was my nickname but now it’s not ours anymore, it’s just how everyone knows me. Now Alecia is more like my nickname, my pet name,” she once told WENN (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Spy</a>).</p><p id=par-6_14>But apart from that, others using her government makes her uncomfortable for another reason.</p><p id=par-7_37>“I’m still getting used to it. It’s very strange. [My husband] Carey uses Alecia when he’s mad at me. When anybody is mad at me they call me Alecia. That’s why it makes me uncomfortable,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reservoir-dogs-actor-steve-buscemi-once-admitted-he-blew-off-pink>‘Reservoir Dogs’ actor Steve Buscemi once admitted he blew off Pink</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_61>Many are aware that <a href=#>Reservoir Dogs’ Steve Buscemi</a> portrayed Mr. Pink in the critically acclaimed Tarantino film. As a fan of the film and Buscemi himself, she couldn’t resist approaching the actor when she spotted him on a New York street. But because Pink asserted that she lacked a certain level of tact, she made the meeting between them quite uncomfortable.</p><p id=par-9_79>“I ran at him on a New York Street,” Pink once explained on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>. “I physically – I’m like a hummingbird with my love. I’m very aggressive. And I remember I was dressed in a silver ensemble. I had short pink hair and a tongue ring. I was just, ‘You’re Steve Buscemi, and I’m Pink, and you’re Pink! And I’m gonna be super famous, and I just love you.’ He’s like, ‘What the f***?’”</p><p id=par-10_24>In his own interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Fallon</a>, Buscemi would address this meeting. He confirmed that Pink did introduce herself to him in New York.</p><p id=par-11_39>“She said, ‘I’m Pink, and I have an album coming out soon.’ This is like 20 years ago. And she said, ‘I got my name sort of because your character in Reservoir Dogs. It was very flattering,” Buscemi said.</p><p id=par-12_29>But Buscemi was about to meet another popular artist in Paul McCartney. Because of this, he admitted he didn’t act too favorably towards Pink with McCartney on his mind.</p><p id=par-13_23>“I was so anxious and nervous about meeting Paul McCartney that I don’t even know if I said anything to her,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qrrKZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2aamqScnruoedGemKVlnpa6pnnUp5qopZakv7WtwaWcZ6Ckorlw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html&text=Pink%20Once%20Explained%20Why%20Calling%20Her%20by%20Her%20Real%20Name%20Makes%20Her%20Uncomfortable&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html&title=Pink%20Once%20Explained%20Why%20Calling%20Her%20by%20Her%20Real%20Name%20Makes%20Her%20Uncomfortable" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html&title=Pink%20Once%20Explained%20Why%20Calling%20Her%20by%20Her%20Real%20Name%20Makes%20Her%20Uncomfortable" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html&title=Pink%20Once%20Explained%20Why%20Calling%20Her%20by%20Her%20Real%20Name%20Makes%20Her%20Uncomfortable" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpink-once-explained-why-calling-her-by-her-real-name-makes-her-uncomfortable.html&description=Pink%20Once%20Explained%20Why%20Calling%20Her%20by%20Her%20Real%20Name%20Makes%20Her%20Uncomfortable" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alucia-l-cole-homicide-case-identified-as-woman-slain-in-joliet-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alucia L.

As of this writing, Jeffree Star has a net worth of $200 million. In addition to being one of the highest-paid YouTube stars on the planet, he oversees a cosmetic empire called Jeffree Star Cosmetics that is the source of the majority of his fortune today. He is known for his striking hair color that is frequently hot pink, and many tattoos.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jeffree Star was born Jeffrey Lynn Steininger Jr. in Orange County, California on November 15, 1985. Tragically, his father, Jeffrey Steininger Sr., committed suicide when he was six years old. He was raised by his mother Marra Shubyann Lindstrom Steininger, who was a model. When he was young, Jeffree would experiment with his mom's makeup. He actually began wearing makeup to school every day in junior high. After graduating from high school he moved to Hollywood to pursue a modeling and makeup career. He also maintained an interest in music. When he first arrived in Hollywood he worked at several makeup counters while booking side-gigs at weddings and fashion shoots.</p><p>Over time he started making celebrity connections for his makeup skills. He also developed a following on social media, MySpace in particular, where he posted makeup tips and songs. He eventually developed one of the largest early MySpace followings with photos posts getting tens of thousands of comments. He was MySpace's most connected profile personality by 2006. He also gained notoriety as one of the most popular unsigned artists on MySpace. His songs also regularly topped MySpace Music's Independent Artists charts.</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Jeffee's debut album "Beauty Killer" was released on Popsicle records in September 2009. The album debuted and peaked at #2 on the Top Heatseekers chart and peaked at #122 on the Billboard 200. It hit #22 on the US Independent Albums chart. It also made the top 10 of the US Dance/Electronic Albums. As of this writing, it's Jeffree's only studio album, though he also released four extended plays, and five music videos. His 2008 EP "Cupcakes Taste Like Violence" also cracked the top 10 on several charts. He worked with <a href=# title="Kesha Net Worth">Kesha</a> and <a href=# title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth">Nicki Minaj</a> and in 2010 signed a record deal with <a href=# title="Akon Net Worth">Akon</a>'s Konvict Muzik for a second album which was never produced. He would later claim that personality clashes with Akon are the reason he walked away from the record deal and the music industry in general.</p><h2 id=jeffree-star-cosmetics><strong>Jeffree Star Cosmetics</strong></h2><p>Jeffree founded his eponymous cosmetics company in 2014 using his entire life savings earned from his music and makeup career up to that point. He would later say he was nearly bankrupt at the time and felt his music career was dead in the water when he launched the company. He was one of the early makeup personalities to use YouTube to promote his brand and himself. Jeffree's early YouTube uploads were still mostly related to his music, but he soon shifted to promoting Jeffree Star Cosmetics. Thanks to friendships with celebrities like <a href=# title="Kat Von D Net Worth">Kat Von D</a>, his following grew quickly.</p><p>His YouTube channel would eventually top 15 million followers with more than 2.6 billion video views.</p><p>His first release was a collection of velour liquid lipsticks.

He then released a line of accessories and clothing including makeup bags and mirrors.</p><p>In 2018 the first mall-based store in the US began carrying Jeffree's line, but the majority of his sales today came from direct fulfillment from his own warehouse in Los Angeles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288690 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/star.jpg alt="Jeffree Star Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288690 class=wp-caption-text>Jeffree Star and Nathan Schwandt via Getty Images</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>In a 2018 interview with YouTuber <a href=# title="Shane Dawson Net Worth">Shane Dawson</a>, Jeffree claimed that his makeup empire's annual gross revenue is north of $100 million.

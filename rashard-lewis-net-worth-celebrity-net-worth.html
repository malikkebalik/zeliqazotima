As a member of the Heat, Lewis won an NBA championship title in 2013.</p><h2 id=career-earnings><strong>Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Over the course of his NBA career, Rashard Lewis earned $155 million in NBA salary alone. His highest-paying season was 2011-2012, when he earned $21 million from the Washington Wizards.</p><h2 id=early-life-high-school><strong>Early Life and High School</strong></h2><p>Rashard Lewis was born on August 8, 1979 in Pineville, Louisiana. As a teenager, he went to Alief Elsik High School in Houston, Texas.</p><h2 id=seattle-supersonics><strong>Seattle SuperSonics</strong></h2><p>Although he had been recruited by the University of Houston, Florida State University, and the University of Kansas, Lewis decided to forgo college for the NBA draft in 1998. He was ultimately selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 32nd overall pick. Along with his teammate <a href=# title="Ray Allen Net Worth">Ray Allen</a>, Lewis was integral in making the SuperSonics a strong team in the early 2000s. On Halloween in 2003, he scored a career high of 50 points in a win over the Los Angeles Clippers in a two-game series in Japan. In the 2004-05 season, Lewis was named an All-Star. He played with the SuperSonics until 2007, finishing his tenure with the record for the most three-pointers made in the team's history, with 973.</p><h2 id=orlando-magic><strong>Orlando Magic</strong></h2><p>After leaving the SuperSonics, Lewis signed with the Orlando Magic in the summer of 2007. He began playing as a power forward in his first season with the team, and topped his personal record for single-season three-pointers, with 226. The Magic went on to reach the second round of the playoffs, where Lewis scored 33 points against the Detroit Pistons in his team's only win of the series. Overall, he was the top scorer in the playoffs, and set personal records for points, assists, and rebounds. Lewis continued his scoring success in the 2008-09 season, once again helping lead the Magic to the playoffs. In the first game of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, he hit the game-winning shot. The Magic won the series and reached the NBA Finals, where they fell to the Lakers in five games. Upon testing positive for a banned substance he had taken in the 2008-09 season, Lewis was suspended without pay for the first ten games of the 2009-10 season.</p><h2 id=washington-wizards><strong>Washington Wizards</strong></h2><p>In late 2010, Lewis was traded to the Washington Wizards.

The Heat made it to the NBA Finals again in 2014 in a rematch with the Spurs, but this time lost in five games.</p><h2 id=dallas-mavericks><strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong></h2><p>In the summer of 2014, Lewis signed with the Dallas Mavericks. Just four days later, however, his contract was voided due to his failed physical, which indicated that he needed surgery on his right knee.</p><h2 id=3-headed-monsters><strong>3 Headed Monsters</strong></h2><p>Three years after leaving the NBA, Lewis joined the 3 Headed Monsters of the Big3 league. On the team, which was coached by NBA Hall of Famer <a href=# title="Gary Payton Net Worth">Gary Payton</a>, Lewis was joined by such teammates as <a href=# title="Jason Williams Net Worth">Jason Williams</a>, <a href=# title="Kwame Brown Net Worth">Kwame Brown</a>, and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf.

He sold this home in October 2009 for $3.35 million.</p><p>In 2007 Rashard paid $4.495 million for a home in Winter Park, Florida. This would prove to be an extreme over-payment.
